## Preparing a Pull Request

We always welcome [Pull Requests](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request). However, before working on a significant change, we recommend opening an issue to discuss your ideas with the maintainers. This helps ensure alignment and facilitates a smoother review process.

To make your Pull Request easier to review and more likely to be accepted, keep it concise. Aim to address a single feature or bug fix per PR; it’s often more effective to submit multiple smaller PRs rather than a single large one. This approach not only simplifies the review process but also makes it easier to track changes.

1. [Fork the repository](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/fork-a-repo)

2. Clone the fork to your local machine:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/<YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME>/configs.git
```

3. Add upstream remote:

```sh
cd configs
git remote add upstream https://github.com/jcsilverx/zphyrix.git
```

4. Synchronize your local `main` branch with the upstream remote:

```sh
git checkout main
git pull upstream main
```

5. Install dependencies with [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/):

   > **Note**: If `pnpm` isn't enabled on your system, you can enable it using [`corepack`](https://nodejs.org/api/corepack.html):
   >
   > ```sh
   > corepack enable pnpm
   > ```

Then, run:

```sh
pnpm install
```

6. Create a new branch related to your PR (the branch name must be written in lowercase)

```sh
git checkout -b <BRANCH_TYPE>/<BRANCH_NAME>
```

- `<BRANCH_TYPE>` is the type of change (e.g., `feat`, `fix`, `chore`, etc.).
- `<BRANCH_NAME>` should be a short, descriptive name for the change you’re making.

7. Make changes, then commit and push to your fork:

```sh
git push -u origin HEAD
```

8. Go to [the repository](https://github.com/jcsilverx/zphyrix.git) and create a [Pull Request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request)

9. Once your pull request is created, we will review it and either merge it, request changes or clarifications, or close it with an explanation.
